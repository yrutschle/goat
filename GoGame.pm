=head1 DESCRIPTION

GoGame contains all the information about a Go Game played in a tournament:
players, handicaps, date of the game, result... and so on. Obviously not
everything might be defined (e.g. result might be undefined if the game hasn't
be played yet).

=cut

=head2 The state machine

Each game is considered like a state machine.  The following
states apply:

=over 4

=item undef

Nothing is known about the game: the players haven't been
notified.

=item challenged

The players have been notified of the game. Parameter: date
of the challenge (to allow for reminders).

=item scheduled

The players have replied to schedule the game, and specified
a location and date. Parameter: date of the game (to not
bother them anymore and ask them for the results after the
game)

=item finished

The game has been played and the result is known. Parameter:
who won? (black|white)

=item canceled

The game has been canceled for some reason. (? Is it useful
to keep track of it then?)

=back

=head2 Attributes of the object

=over 4

=item black

FFGPlayer object of the black player

=item white 

FFGPlayer object of the black player

=item state

(one of the values specified above)

=item handicap

Handicap at which the game is to be player

=item challenge_date

=item scheduled_date

=item reminder_date

The dates are GMT, seconds from 1970. reminder_date corresponds to the date of
the last reminder sent to the players about that game: before the game, when
was the last reminder about organising the game sent; after the game, when was
the last reminder about sending in the results sent.

=item location

Location for a scheduled game.

=item result

Who won the game (black or white).

=item winner

FFGPlayer object that won the game

=item loser

FFGPlayer object that lost the game

=item rated

True if the game is to be submitted to a rating system. (Typically, we don't
want games that haven't been played to count towards the rating system).

=item submitted

True if the game was submitted to the rating system. This is to keep track of
what has already be submitted and ease partial submissions.

=item sgf

Path to the SGF file of the finished game, if any.
